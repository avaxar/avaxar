 Hi! Welcome to my GitHub profile. I'm a university student from Indonesia currently pursuing my Bachelor's degree on computer science. I do programming projects like many other GitHub users, often using Python, C++, or [D](https://dlang.org). You can see more about me [here](https://avaxar.dev) on my website.
